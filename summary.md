📄 Summary – Introduction & Overview

Education plays a crucial role in societal development by driving innovation, building human capital, and preparing individuals for a rapidly changing world. Traditional teaching methods, especially lecture-based learning, often fail to engage students effectively.

The research emphasizes the need for innovative teaching approaches that focus on technology integration, active learning, and student-centered instruction. These methods help students develop deeper understanding, creativity, and essential skills required to meet modern challenges.

Innovative teaching makes learning more interactive, accessible, and aligned with real-world requirements—especially with the growing influence of digital tools and globalization.
